Baseline model: 
CT Slice -> ResUnet -> R/L lung (2 channels) 
    -> cat(CT Slice,R+L lungs) -> ResUnet -> Infection (1 channel)
First train:
- Max res: 128, max batch size: 8 (NVIDIA GeForce 1660 Super, 6GB)
- Train lung first -> train infection model with best lung model in eval mode
- Models overfit with no augmentations
- Infection model overfit much worse/more quickly than lung model
To do:
- Lower patience value
- Add augmentations:
    - Vertical Flip (Horizontal would confuse L/R lung, could switch masks?)
    - Rotation/Shear may help at some point, but will add a lot of code (need custom implementation for masks)
    - Gaussian Blur -> same as above
- Refine how results are output, include an experiment name, or auto and save configs?

11-21-2021
- Fixed environment.yml with --no-builds
- Added Vertical Flip
- Refined result output for training, added exp_name as 'baseline'
- lowered patience 25 -> 10
Second Train:
- w/ vertical flip, models were somewhat better
- Infection model still overfitting, though not as bad as w/o augs 
To Do:
- Add rotation augmentations
- Possibly add dropout layers to model (where to do this?)
- Need to add min losses to title of loss result outputs
Third Train:
- Adding rotations improved slightly, infection model still overfitting a bit
- May be good to try infection model without lungs for comparison

Current Metrics (flip_rotate-aug)
- Attempting train with infection model w/o lungs, single channel input of image
Fourth Train:
- Overfit worse w/o lungs, metrics show inf model is not predicting infected areas due to small size
- Cropping and zoom would be too inconsistent
- need to train with full lung masks, was using lungs w/o infected areas, may help
- Train for lungs on single channel, segment both instead of L/R, simplifies and allows for more augmentations such as horizontal flip and 90 deg rotate. Should tone down rotation chance, may be too high and affecting training
- Try 2 channel output, single model with lungs/inf?

11-28-21
- Adding validation visuals (finally) for metrics and sample visuals
- Infection Model is actually not terrible, it seems to overfit to the less confident lung areas, using full lung masks to train lung model should fix
Fifth Train:
- Definitely did not help with full lung masks

12-1-21
- Attempting train with combined model, single Unet with 2 channel output 
- Will the loss function for the lung channel outweigh the infection channel?
- Waste of time, can't optimize for infection, need to zoom on ROI
- Need to figure out a consistent contour/edge-det/crop method to 'zoom' on RoI

12-10-2021
- Added RoI cropping method:
    - Threshold image based on image type (corona or radio)
        - Threshold is estimated from sample distributions in 0-255 scale
    - Mask is dilated 5 iterations to seal up any possible missing connecting pixels
    - Get external contours of image 
    - Get contour with maximum areas
    - return x, y, w, h from bounding rectangle
